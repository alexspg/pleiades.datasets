It is located on the acropolis adjacent to an odeon and near a gymnasium, a theater, and the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios. The stadium, which is one stadion (600ft or 200m) long, was used for sporting events like the footrace, and probably for other entertainments as well. The stadium was excavated and restored by an Italian team during the early 20th century, but very little archaeological work has been done on this site since then. Currently, the only original parts of the stadium which are preserved are the sphendone (rounded end with turning post), the proedries (seats of honor), and a few rows of seats in the auditorium.</p>",
